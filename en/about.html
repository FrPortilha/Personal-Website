            <a> Finance, Impact and Data Intern - Joint Impact Model Foundation <p> <d>December 2023 to May 2024</d></p></a>
            <li>
              The Joint Impact Model Foundation is a non-profit fondation in sustainable finance. Founded by FMO, BII, DEG, 
            </li>
            <li>
              As an intern working with finance, impact and data at the Joint Impact Model Foundation, my duties are quite broad. 
              From assisting the <a2>technical development</a2> of the model and testing new modules, to running the model for members and 
              <a2>analysing impact results</a2> of their portfolio for them. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Being emerged in the world of sustainable finance at the JIM foundation leads you to, more often than not, diving deep 
              in specific sectors to understand their intricacies, which leads to very interesting weeks! (e.g. starting the week 
              researching the agriculture sector in Mexico and finish the week looking at the concrete sector in Nepal)

              faculty level decisions. This requires preperation for each meeting, with my fellow student council members.
              Skills needed as a council member are <a2>strategic thinking</a2> and <a2>debating</a2> as these will generate the greates 
              impact for the school.
